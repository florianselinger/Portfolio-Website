                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm Florian Selinger and live in Germany. My goal is it to become a good Full Stack Developer.
                        I currently work on front-end development and have mastered skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        Originally, I am a trained Car-Mechanic and have worked in this profession for 4 years. After that,
                        I decided to change my career path and started learning development. I don't have a formal degree in computer science,
                        neither do I have years of experience, but I am highly motivated and eager to learn more every day.
                        Since this is my personal website, I want to make something special to showcase my skills and projects.

                        After I finish my training as a Full Stack Developer, I want to work in a company where I can contribute my skills
                        and grow as a developer. I am open to new challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.
                        Also I want to connect with other developers and learn from their experiences. And I want to specialize in
                        Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
